"This paper tackles the classical problem of plagiarism detection by employing current state-of-the-art NLP methods based on Deep Learning. We investigate whether transformer models may be used along with existing solutions for plagiarism detection, such as Encoplot and clustering, to improve their results. Experimental results show that transformers represent a good solution for capturing the semantics of texts when dealing with plagiarism. Further efficiency improvements are needed as the proposed method is highly effective but also requires high computational resources. This prototype approach paves the way to further fine-tuning such that we may obtain a solution that scales well for a large number of source documents and large-sized documents."
